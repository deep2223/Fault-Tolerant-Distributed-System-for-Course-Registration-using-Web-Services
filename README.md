# Fault-Tolerant-Distributed-System-for-Course-Registration-using-Web-Services
Created a course registration system that can handle software failures or crash failures at a time using Web Services - Java.

Implement the Distributed Course Registration System (DCRS) from https://github.com/deep2223/Fault-Tolerant-Distributed-System-for-Course-Registration-using-CORBA.git as a web service. 

Specifically, design the service from https://github.com/deep2223/Fault-Tolerant-Distributed-System-for-Course-Registration-using-CORBA.git
(using the same functions and exceptions) by doing the following:

â€¢ Extract the Java client-server implementation by removing the CORBA specific code from 
https://github.com/deep2223/Fault-Tolerant-Distributed-System-for-Course-Registration-using-CORBA.git

1. Properly annotate your Java implementation to adapt it as a web service. 
2. Build the end point files using the wsgen command before publishing the service. 
3. Import the wsdl files using the wsimport command.
